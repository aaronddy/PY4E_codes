a story of two collections

1. List
  : A linear collection of values that stay in order
    like a Pringles, that stack in order

2. Dictionary
  : A "bag" of values, each with its own label, there's no order
    it's like a key with its own label


    - Dictionaries are Python's most powerful data collection
    - Dictionaries allow us to do fast database-like operations in Python
    - Dictionaries have different names in different languages
       - Associative Arrays(연관배열) - Perl / PHP
       - Properties or Map or HashMap - Java
       - Property Bag = C# / .Net


    Lists index their entries based on the position in the List.
    Dictionaries are like bags - no order, so we index the things we put in the Dictionary with a "lookup tag"
