1. Relational Databases
: Relational Databases model data by storing rows and colums in tables. The power of Relational Databases lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables
and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships between those tables involved in the query.

- Database: contains many tables
- Relation (or table): contains tuples and attributes
- Tuple (or row): a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track
- Attribute (also column or field): one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row

2. SQL
: Structured Query Language is the language we used to issue commands to the database

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
